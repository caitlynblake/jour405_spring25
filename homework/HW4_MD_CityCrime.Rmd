title: "HW4 MD CityCrime"
---

In this assignment, we will be working with a dataset of total crimes reported by Maryland cities for two consecutive years. You'll load the data, calculate the violent and property crime rates for each city for both years, and then calculate the percentage change in the crime rates between the two years. You'll also write a short story based on your findings.

### Task 1: Load the Tidyverse and Janitor

You will need to load the tidyverse library and the janitor library

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Then you'll load the data from the web. The URL for the data is: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/md_cities_crime_2019_2020.csv. You will create a dataframe called `md_cities` that contains the data from this URL.

### Task 2: Load the Data

```{r}
md_cities <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/md_cities_crime_2019_2020.csv")
```
### Task 3: Calculating Rates

Calculate violent and property crime rates for each city for both years using `mutate()`. You'll create four new columns: `violent_rate_2019`, `property_rate_2019`, `violent_rate_2020`, and `property_rate_2020`. You'll need to figure out the proper unit rate, given that there are varying populations. There's no perfect choice; choose the one that works best for you. Save the results to a new dataframe called `md_cities_rates`.

```{r}
md_cities_rates <- md_cities |> mutate(violent_rate_2019 = violent2019/pop2019 * 10000, property_rate_2019 = property2019/pop2019 * 10000, violent_rate_2020 =
violent2020/pop2020 * 10000, property_rate_2020 = property2020/pop2020 * 10000)
```

### Task 4: Describe the Rates

Examine the new dataframe, `md_cities_rates`, by clicking on it in the Environment tab in RStudio and sorting by the rate columns. Write a couple of sentences about the results, comparing and contrasting the cities with the highest rates (both violent and property) in 2019 and 2020. Do you see any patterns? What does this tell you about crime in Maryland cities? What's the story here?

The hihest violent crime rate was Baltimore in 2019 and Ocean City in 2020, with Baltimore at 2nd. The highest property crime rate was Ocean City in 2019 and 2020. Clearly, these two cities have a trend for high crime. 


### Task 5: Calculate Percentage Change

Let's add two percentage change columns to your dataframe: one for violent crime rates and one for property crime rates. You'll calculate the percentage change between 2019 and 2020 for each city. Save the results to a new dataframe called `md_cities_change`.

```{r}
md_cities_change <- md_cities_rates |> mutate(violent_pct_change = (violent_rate_2020 - violent_rate_2019)/violent_rate_2019 * 100,
property_pct_change = (property_rate_2020 - property_rate_2019)/property_rate_2019 * 100)

```

### Task 7: Describe Percentage Changes

Look at the `md_cities_change` dataframe by clicking on it in the Environment tab in RStudio. Write a couple of sentences describing the percentage change results. What's more interesting here, the patterns or the outliers? What's the story in the data?

The violent percentage change in Ocean City was 82.89%, while the property percentage change was 16.97%. The violent percentage change in Baltimore was -12.88%, while the property percentage change was -25.94%. Even though Baltimore's crime is pretty high, it is decreasing, while OC is going up.


### Task 8: Tell the Best Story

Write up a lede and nutgraf of a story with the _best_ story idea you've found in this assignment. The lede should be a single sentence that summarizes the most important information in the data. The nutgraf should be a paragraph that provides more context and explains why the data is important.

Ocean City - the unexpected crime capitol in Maryland.

Although Baltimore is often seen as a dangerous place riddled with crime, there have been major leaps in crime reduction. On the other hand, Ocean City's violent and property crime rates are on the rise. Between 2019 and 2020 Baltimore's violent crime rate decreased by 12.88%, while Ocean City increased by a whopping 82.89%. 


### Task 9: Save Your Work and Put it on GitHub

Save this notebook, then commit it to your local repository. Push the changes to your GitHub repository and submit the URL for this file in ELMS.

### Task 10: Percentiles

Using the 2020 violent crime rate, calculate the percentiles using `ntile()`. Save the results to a new dataframe called `md_cities_percentiles`. How many cities are above the 90th percentile?
Calculate the Interquartile Range of the 2020 violent crime rate using `summarize()` and R's `IQR()` function. The syntax is similar to how `mean()` works.
Do the results change your best story idea from the previous assignment? Why or why not?

```{r}
md_percentiles <- md_cities_rates |> mutate(percentile = ntile(violent_rate_2020, 100))

md_percentiles |>  summarize(IQR_violent_crime_rate_2020 = IQR(violent_rate_2020, na.rm = TRUE))
```

The IQR rate is 41.99 but I am not sure what that means for the data. I wanted to turn something in before midnight, I will resubmit when I figure it out.
